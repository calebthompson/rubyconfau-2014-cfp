# Not Invented Here: Things Rails Didn't Invent

Rails is a mixture of design patterns, practices, and magic. In this talk, we'll
explore how Rails embraces ideas from other frameworks and projects.

Active Record was born of Martin Fowler. MVC was the brainchild of Trygve
Reenskaug. Rails 3 completely absorbed the Merb project, gaining modularity and
extensibility that it previously lacked.

We all learn by standing on the shoulders of giants, even Rails. By
understanding the inception of design patterns, we are more likely to be able to
create ideas of our own. This helps us to not only grow in our own ability, but
to help others improve as well.
